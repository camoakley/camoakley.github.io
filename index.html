                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        As a kid, I didn't have any interests or hobbies; I was not interested in sports or sciences and I would run home after school everyday to play video games. As high school graduation approached, I felt lost compared to most because I didn't have any skills or hobbies that I could to turn into a career. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating high school, I started as a temp at my local Sheriff's Office. At the time, I had no interest in pursuing a degree in computer science, I was majoring in psychology and hoping to apply that to a career with law enforcement. A few months into working at the Sheriff's Office, I got transferred to the IT unit and began helping with low-level computer support tasks. Some months later, I met with the IT manager and who encouraged me to switch my major to computer science. This conversation is the sole reason for me pursuing computer science today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before starting my computer science coursework, I watched CompTIA Sec+ certification videos. I watched an entire e-series, and it put into perspective the importance of both network security and cybersecurity. Even though I couldn't understand most of the content, like PKI and the OSI model, I knew that I wanted to work in the field of computer networking or cybersecurity.

                    <hr>
                    <h5>Project Details</h5>
                    <p> 
                        The focus of my research falls under the category of mesh networks, network security, and layer 3 attacks. Specifically, I am investigating Blackhole attacks, which is a form of layer 3 DoS attacks which can disrupt network reliability.
                    </p>
                    <h5>FAQ: What Is A MANET?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs) is an under researched approach to wireless network architectures. There are a few key differences that separates MANETs from open wireless networks. The first being, that nodes have the ability to join the network and use network resources without approval from a central authority. Additionally, nodes can leave the network without much impact to efficiency and reliability. Another important feature of a MANET is that nodes act as routers. In a traditional wireless network, devices act as a client share the network resources. In MANETs, nodes play a role in routing information through the network. Lastly, the network is self-sustaining as nodes in this network are meant to be mobile, the network architecture is constantly adapting to changes within the network. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>FAQ: What Is A Blackhole Attack?</h5>
                    <p>
                        For an efficient operation of a MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network), establishing a baseline level of trust among its nodes is essential. However, this inherent trust can be vulnerable to exploitation by malicious nodes. MANETs, like traditional networks, are susceptible to layer 3 attacks. The unique challenge in MANETs arises from the active involvement of nodes in routing information, allowing a malicious node the capability to intentionally drop all packets directed towards it. This form of attack is known as a Blackhole attack, posing a significant threat to the network's reliability and integrity.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Mitigation Strategies For Blackhole Attacks</h5>
                    <p>
                        Various methods have been proposed for detecting and mitigating Blackhole attacks. One brute-force strategy involves forwarding traffic to a neighbor and switching to another if no response is received. Another approach entails incorporating additional ACK messages, with nodes along the path sending ACK messages to the origin node, thereby informing it of undropped packets. However, the most efficient method appears to be maintaining a memory-based table that monitors the trust level between known neighboring nodes. In this approach, successful packet transmissions between two nodes result in an increment of trust value between them.
                    </p>
                    <h5>My Research Progress</h5>
                    <p>
                        I have served as the primary researcher on this project, receiving guidance from Dr. Sam Ogden. My achievements include completing a comprehensive literature review, establishing an emulation environment through the deployment of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWrt">OpenWRT embedded operating system</a>, compiling the BATMAN routing protocols as kernel drivers, and developing a framework for the BATMAN routing protocol.

                    <h5>Presentations</h5>
                    <p>
                        I presented my findings and progress described above at several research symposiums hosted at CSU Monterey Bay. These have helped my develop my skills in describing the technicalities of my research and present my findings coherently.
