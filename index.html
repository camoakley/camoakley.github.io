                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Tldr; I am passionate about CS. I would like have a career programming and engineering secure systems.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Background</h4>
                    <p>
                        Before graduating from <a href="https://www.salinasuhsd.org/Domain/11">high school</a>, I realized that I had no skills or hobbies that I wanted to turn into a career. My dad worked in law enforcement, and it eventually became a career that I wanted to follow. After graduating high school in 2019, I started helping around the office at my local <a href="https://montereysheriff.org/">Sheriff's Office</a>. At the time, I had no interest in pursuing a degree in CS as I was majoring in Psychology and hoping to apply that to a career with law enforcement. A few months into working at the Sheriff's Office, I got transferred to the IT unit and began helping with low-level computer support tasks. I developed a strong relationship with the IT manager, and she expressed to me that she thought I should switch my major to CS. After that conversation, I did. Something worth mentioning is that I am still working here today, but I'm now at the level of a <a href="https://www.co.monterey.ca.us/government/departments-a-h/human-resources/human-resources/class-specifications">Senior DISC</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around this time, I had begun watching <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security">CompTIA Sec+</a> training videos. I watched an entire e-series, and it put into perspective how big the field of CS is, and even though I couldn't understand most of what I was learning from those videos, I knew that I wanted to work in Networking or Cybersecurity. When I finally began my CS-related coursework at the <a href="https://www.hartnell.edu/">local community college</a>, I was surprised to find that it was heavily focused on programming. I took my first programming course in the Fall of 2020, and I was the only person in the class who hadn't written a line of code before. After completing courses like Data Structures, Computer Architecture and Assembly, and Calculus I and II, I was ready to transfer to a university. I transferred to <a href="https://csumb.edu/">California State University, Monterey Bay</a> (CSUMB) in the Fall of 2022.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At CSUMB, I have taken some of the advanced CS classes like Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Algorithms, and Computer Networks. Also, I was presented with more opportunities to develop my knowledge in the various fields in CS.I am currently apart of <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/">UROC</a> which is an undergraduate research program. I'll talk more about my research down in the <a href="#research">About My Research</a> section. I also got involved with the <a href="https://csumbnetsecteam.blogspot.com/">Network Security Team</a> which is a club that competes in various <a href="https://ctftime.org/">hackathons</a> throughout the semester. One thing worth mentioning is that I am still very active in the club and I hold the rank of Vice President.

                    <h3>About My Research</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Project Details</h4>
                    <p> 
                        The focus of my research falls under the category of mesh networks, mesh network security, and layer 3 attacks. Specifically, I am investigating Blackhole attacks, which is a form of layer 3 DoS attacks which can disrupt network reliability (more on this later). My research advisor is Dr. Sam Ogden who was also my professor for the Intro to Computer Networks course. We created this project as I was enrolled in that course. Mesh networks were something that me and a fellow classmate shared an interest in. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>What Is The Field?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs) is an under researched approach to wireless network architectures. There are a few key differences that separates MANETs from open wireless networks. The first being, that nodes have the ability to join the network and use network resources without approval from a central authority. Additionally, nodes can leave the network without much impact to efficiency and reliability. Another important feature of a MANET is that nodes act as routers. In a traditional wireless network, devices act as a client share the network resources. In MANETs, nodes play a role in routing information through the network. Lastly, the network is self-sustaining as nodes in this network are meant to be mobile, the network architecture is constantly adapting to changes within the network. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>What Is A Blackhole Attack?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order for a MANET to operate efficiently, there needs to be a level of trust between the nodes. This level of trust can be easily exploited by malicious nodes. MANETs are susceptible to the same layer 3 attacks as traditional networks. Although, given the fact that nodes play a role in routing information within the network, a malicious node has the ability to drop all of the packets sent to it. This is called a Blackhole attack which can disrupt the reliability of the network. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Solutions For Blackhole Attacks</h4>
                    <p>
                        Several methods have been introduced to find and prevent Blackhole attacks. A brute-force approach is to try one route and a node doesn't receive any response, then it tries another route. Another approach is to increase the number of ACK messages sent, nodes in the path to the destination node will send ACK messages to the origin node so that the origin knows packets have not been dropped. The most efficient approach seems to be keeping a table in memory that tracks the level of trust between known neighboring nodes. Essentially, if two nodes have a successful packet transmission, then they will trust each other more.
