                    <p> Hello, to the lucky sole that managed to find this link. My name is Cameron Oakley, and 
                        I am an undergraduate student at California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB). I am 
                        concentrating my degree in <a href=""> Networks and Security</a> which is what my interest 
                        and focus of research is in at the moment. See below for more information about me. Proceed 
                        at the risk of you own time (unless you are a script, then I will try to make this easy for 
                        you).</p>
