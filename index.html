                    <h2> Getting Your Attention </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p> 
                        Hello, to the lucky soul that managed to find this link. My name is Cameron Oakley, and 
                        I am an undergraduate student at <a href="https://csumb.edu/">California State University Monterey Bay</a> (CSUMB). I am 
                        concentrating my degree in <a href="https://csumb.edu/scd/cs-course-curriculum/">Networks and Security</a> which is what my interest 
                        and focus of research is in at the moment. See below for some quick information about me. 
                        Proceed at the risk of you own time (unless you are a script, then I will try to make this 
                        easy for you).
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        If you care for more information about me, then more detailed information will be included 
                        on the <a href="pages\about.html">About page</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2> My Background in Three Paragraphs</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        After graduating high school in 2019 I landed an IT-related internship at my local <a href="">Sheriff's Office</a>. 
                        At the time, I had no interest in pursuing a degree in CS as I was majoring in Psychology and hoping to apply that
                        to a career with law enforcement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a few months of working at this internship, I started watching training videos <a href="">CompTIA Sec+</a>
                        and this was my first real exposure to CS. After this, I switched my major to CS and began pursuing it. I later
                        transferred from Hartnell Community College to CSUMB where I am currently attending. Since watching those first
                        CompTIA Sec+ training videos, I have kept an interest in computer networks and cybersecurity, even though most of my 
                        coursework has been focused on programming. I believe this is why I am drawn to the field of reverse engineering. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At CSUMB I was presented with more opportunites to get involved in CS projects and develop skills not taught in 
                        the courses I was taking. This leads us to today, where I am conducting undergraduate research and am juggling 
                        several different projects related to my interests in CS.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        My favorite classes that I have completed so far: Introduction to Computer Networks, Algorithms and Algorithm Design, 
                        Internet Programming, Software Engineering, and Data Structures.
                    </p>

                        If I haven't lost your attention yet, allow me to explain some of the projects I am currently working on. I'm 
                        interested in most things that are CS-realted, but computer networks and cybersecurity are what I am most 
                        interested in. As of the time of writing, I am working on the following projects related to my interests:

                                At the time of writing, I have deleved pretty deep into understanding the field and issue. I am working on finding a MANET 
                                routing protocol I can use in a simulated environement to develop a mitigation strategy.

                                prepared better. It motivated me to sit down and begin studying for the CCNA exam. The CCNA exam itself is an intro 
                                networking certification and teaches you the theory of computer netowrks along with how to use networking hardware.

                                my knowledge of programming and love for security, it is almost he perfect mix for me. I am actively reading through a
