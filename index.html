                    <p> 
                        Hello, to the lucky sole that managed to find this link. My name is Cameron Oakley, and 
                        I am an undergraduate student at California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB). I am 
                        concentrating my degree in <a href="">Networks and Security</a> which is what my interest 
                        and focus of research is in at the moment. See below for some quick information about me. 
                        Proceed at the risk of you own time (unless you are a script, then I will try to make this

                    <h2> My Current Interests </h2>
                    <p> 
                        If I haven't lost you attention yet, let me explain some of my interests. I am interested in 
                        both networking and cybersecurity. As of the time of writing, I am juggling several different 
                        projects. 
                    </p>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                I'm apart of a program at CSUMB called <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/">UROC</a> which 
                                is essentially an undergraduate research rpogram. The focus of my research is on securing 
                                <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-mobile-ad-hoc-network-manet/">MANETs</a> 
                                from <a href="">Blackhole attacks</a>.

                                I'm currently studying for my CCNA exam and plan on taking my exam sometime in the Fall of 2023.
                                Additionally, I am building a home lab in order to solidify the theory that I am leanring. I 
                                bought some networking equipment off of eBay and I'm building a lab in my room.
