                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Tldr; I am passionate about computer science and programming, and I would like to pursue a career programming and engineering secure systems.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Background</h4>
                    <p>
                        I was never the kid who had defined interests, I was not interested in sports or sciences. To capture the kind of kid I was, I would run home after school to play video games. As high school graduation approached, I felt lost compared to most as I did not have any skills or hobbies that I could to turn into a career. My dad worked in law enforcement, and it eventually became a career that I wanted to follow. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating high school in 2019, I started as a temp at my local <a href="https://montereysheriff.org/">Sheriff's Office</a>. At the time, I had no interest in pursuing a degree in computer science, I was majoring in psychology and hoping to apply that to a career with law enforcement. A few months into working at the Sheriff's Office, I got transferred to the IT unit and began helping with low-level computer support tasks. Some months later, I met with the IT manager and who encouraged me to switch my major to computer science. This conversation was the catalyst for me pursuing computer science, and after that conversation I switched my major.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before starting my computer science coursework in college, I watched <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security">CompTIA Sec+</a> certification videos. I watched an entire e-series, and it put into perspective the importance of both network security and cybersecurity. Even though I could not understand most of the content like PKI and the OSI model, I knew that I wanted to work in the field of computer networking or cybersecurity. 
                        <!-- Now, I realize my interests in the field opposed my peers. It is clear that my peers wanted to create new software, and I wanted to engineer secure systems.  -->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After obtaining my Associates of Science in computer science, I transferred to CSU Monterey Bay where I am currently in the last year of my Bachelor of Science program. Additionally, throughout my undergraduate education I have worked at the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, where I started as a Temp with no technical experience and promoted to the level of Senior IT Analyst.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Passions</h4>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Programming</h5>
                    <p>
                        In 2020, I switched my major to computer science, and after enrolling in my first computer science course it became clear that I was the only student who had never written a line of code before, or even knew what a computer program was. I recall struggling on the first homework assignment, where we simply needed to take input from users and display values in the console. Despite these early struggles, I soon learned to love programming. The Data Structures & Algorithms course offered at Hartnell piqued my interest in programming, it showed the complexity of programming, as well as, how it can be used in everyday software products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I transferred to CSU Monterey Bay, I was offered a plethora of computer science courses. I knew that the cybersecurity courses would be my focus, but I went out of my way to take courses that interested me. It was because of this motivation that I took courses in Software Engineering and Internet Programming, where I learned skills that I use throughout all of my projects. This is where I learned how to program front-end and back-end servers, write unit and end-to-end tests, and collaborate with other students on large projects and pull requests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My passion for programming stems beyond the classroom. Currently, I am working on several self-guided projects like "<a href="https://github.com/camsterrrr/CSafe/tree/main">CSafe</a>", where I am creating a password manager written in C. In this, I hope to use all of the programming skills built-up over my programming tenure. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Computer Networking</h5>
                    <p>
                        In May 2023, I interviewed for a Network Engineer Internship and completely bombed it. Embarrassed for not performing the best I could, I started studying for the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html">CCNA</a> exam. This exam is where I learned the fundamentals of networking and building functional networks. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am building up a home networking lab where I use old Cisco hardware bought off 0 eBay and configuring the hardware to work within my network lab. By doing this, I am getting practical experience building functional networks. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                    <p>
                        I lift heavy circles... For fun... One of my biggest passions is body building. My closest fried motivated me to start working out in high school, and since then I have worked out religiously. I believe it is the thing that keeps me sane and grounds me when life ramps up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am teaching myself how to play guitar. Both of my brothers play guitar, but I was never given the opportunity to learn. Learning guitar has always been a bucket list item for me. Currently, I can form chords comfortably and switch relatively fast. However, I need to improve making everything sound pretty.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Family</h4>
                    <p>
                        The two most important "people" in my life is my girlfriend, Alexis, and our kitty, Juniper (M). Alexis and I are high school sweethearts, we both enjoy playing Minecraft, and I host my own Minecraft server in my room so that we could play together. She enjoys the Witcher Netflix series, and I do too, but I also enjoy the books and video games. As for Juniper, Alexis's grandma passed away in 2020, and just before she passed her kitty gave birth to a litter. Juniper was the runt of this litter. It's funny because usually the runts are very shy, but Juniper walks around the house like he owns the place, and has the audacity to annoy us while we sleep.

                    <h3>Research Experience</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Project Details</h4>
                    <p> 
                        The focus of my research falls under the category of mesh networks, network security, and layer 3 attacks. Specifically, I am investigating Blackhole attacks, which is a form of layer 3 DoS attacks which can disrupt network reliability.
                    </p>
                    <h5>What Is A MANET?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs) is an under researched approach to wireless network architectures. There are a few key differences that separates MANETs from open wireless networks. The first being, that nodes have the ability to join the network and use network resources without approval from a central authority. Additionally, nodes can leave the network without much impact to efficiency and reliability. Another important feature of a MANET is that nodes act as routers. In a traditional wireless network, devices act as a client share the network resources. In MANETs, nodes play a role in routing information through the network. Lastly, the network is self-sustaining as nodes in this network are meant to be mobile, the network architecture is constantly adapting to changes within the network. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>What Is A Blackhole Attack?</h4>
                    <p>
                        For an efficient operation of a MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network), establishing a baseline level of trust among its nodes is essential. However, this inherent trust can be vulnerable to exploitation by malicious nodes. MANETs, like traditional networks, are susceptible to layer 3 attacks. The unique challenge in MANETs arises from the active involvement of nodes in routing information, allowing a malicious node the capability to intentionally drop all packets directed towards it. This form of attack is known as a Blackhole attack, posing a significant threat to the network's reliability and integrity.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Mitigation Strategies For Blackhole Attacks</h4>
                    <p>
                        Various methods have been proposed for detecting and mitigating Blackhole attacks. One brute-force strategy involves forwarding traffic to a neighbor and switching to another if no response is received. Another approach entails incorporating additional ACK messages, with nodes along the path sending ACK messages to the origin node, thereby informing it of undropped packets. However, the most efficient method appears to be maintaining a memory-based table that monitors the trust level between known neighboring nodes. In this approach, successful packet transmissions between two nodes result in an increment of trust value between them.

                    <h4>My Research Progress</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have served as the primary researcher on this project, receiving guidance from Dr. Sam Ogden. My achievements include completing a comprehensive literature review, establishing an emulation environment through the deployment of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWrt">OpenWRT embedded operating system</a>, compiling the BATMAN routing protocols as kernel drivers, and developing a framework for the BATMAN routing protocol.

                    <h3>Employment</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Monterey County Sheriff's Office</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most people associate my academic and professional success as me being naturally smart. However, I believe my work ethic has been defined by learning from my failures. Before starting my Junior year of high school, I had an internship at a family friend's company, where I performed the worst I possibly could. My work performance was highlighted by a weak work ethic and failure to derive anything from the internship beyond a paycheck. This experience taught me humility, and I was embarrassed of my performance and vouched to never under perform again. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The value learned from this humility follows me in everything I do, the most notable being my work at the Monterey County Sheriff's Office (MCSO). When I began working at MCSO in 2019, I vouched to not under perform. Throughout my tenure, I have gone out of my way to learn all that I can and take on as much responsibility as I could and derive value beyond a paycheck.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2021, I held the position of a Student Intern and my unit had shrunk from seven IT staff members to just four, including myself. I saw this as an opportunity to take on new responsibilities like responding to service requests and managing systems like MCSO's WordPress site, which allowed the Senior IT Analysts to work on projects. It was because of this my Manager directly advocated for me to be promoted to Senior IT Analyst, which the Undersheriff and Chief Deputy approved of.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am still working at MCSO as a Senior IT Analyst, and having worked at MCSO for a five years and nearing the completion of my undergraduate degree, I thrive in the work environment. While MCSO, couldn't compare to the likes of interning at Silicon Valley companies like Google, I believe this position has been optimal for broadening my understanding of computer science. This position has been exposed to a plethora of issues ranging from Windows OS issues to networking infrastructure issues. This exposure has broadened my understanding of computer science and actively reinforces what I learn in my coursework. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>Monterey County Office of Emergency Services</h4>
                    <p>
                        In early 2020, I volunteered at the Monterey County Office of Emergency Services (OES), where I helped coordinate volunteer efforts between the various county departments as the COVID-19 pandemic was ramping up. My position was crucial as I began working when there was not many staff, my coordination efforts allowed the office to build up to a maximum staffing of close to a hundred volunteers.

                    <p>
                        This position offered one of the most stressful environments I have worked in throughout my employment, which has helped define my ability to work under pressure and meet deadlines. These skills directly transferred over to my grind as an unpaid Student Intern at MCSO in 2021.
