                    <p> 
                        Hello, to the lucky soul that managed to find this link. My name is Cameron Oakley, and 
                        I am an undergraduate student at <a href="https://csumb.edu/">California State University Monterey Bay</a> (CSUMB). I am 
                        concentrating my degree in <a href="https://csumb.edu/scd/cs-course-curriculum/">Networks and Security</a> which is what my interest 
                        and focus of research is in at the moment. See below for some quick information about me. 
                        Proceed at the risk of you own time (unless you are a script, then I will try to make this 
                        easy for you).
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        If you care for more information about me, then more detailed information will be included 
                        on the <a href="pages\about.html">About page</a>.

                    <p> 
                        If I haven't lost your attention yet, allow me to explain some of my interests. I'm interested in both 
                        networking and cybersecurity. Most of my coursework has been focused around programming and I think 
                        this knowledge led me to develop an interest in reverse engineering. As of the time of writing, I am 
                        juggling several different projects related to my interests. 
                    </p>

                            I'm apart of a program at CSUMB called <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/">UROC</a> which 
                            is essentially an undergraduate research program. The focus of my research is on securing 
                            <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-mobile-ad-hoc-network-manet/">MANETs</a>

                            exam and plan on taking my exam sometime in the Fall of 2023. Additionally, I am building a home lab 
                            in order to solidify the theory that I am leanring. I bought some networking equipment off of eBay 
                            and I'm building a lab in my room.
