                    <h2> About My Research </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p> 
                        At CSUMB, I am apart of a program called <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/">UROC</a> which is an undergraduate research 
                        program. The goal of the program is to provide undergraduate students with an opportunity
                        to conduct graduate-level research. Each participant works on a project with the help of
                        their research advisor. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        The focus of my research falls under the category of mesh networks, mesh network security, and 
                        layer 3 attacks. Specifically, I am investigating Blackhole attacks, which is a form of 
                        layer 3 DoS attacks which can disrupt network reliability (more on this later). My 
                        research advisor is <a href="https://www.samogden.net/">Dr. Sam Ogden</a> who was also my professor for the Intro to Computer 
                        Networks course. We created this project as I was enrolled in that course. Mesh networks 
                        were something that me and a fellow classmate shared an interest in.

                    <h2> Project Details </h2>

                        Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs) is an underresearched approach to wireless network architectures. 
                        There are a few key differences that seperates MANETs from open wireless netowrks. The first being, that 
                        nodes have the ability to join the network and use network resources without approval from a central authority. 
                        Additionally, nodes can leave the network without much impact to efficiency and reliabilty. Another important 
                        feature of a MANET is that nodes act as routers. In a traditional wireless network, devices act as a client 
                        share the network resources. In MANETs, nodes play a role in routing information through the network. Lastly, the network
                        is self-sustaining as nodes in this network are meant to be mobile, the network architecture is constantly 
                        adapting to changes within the network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order for a MANET to operate efficiently, there needs to be a level of trust between the nodes. This level
                        of trust can be easily exploited by malcious nodes. MANETs are susceptible to the same layer 3 attacks as 
                        traditional networks. Although, given the fact that nodes play a role in routing information within the network, a malicious node has 
                        the ability to drop all of the packets sent to it. This is called a Blackhole attack which can disrupt the 
                        reliability of the network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Several methods have been introduced to find and prevent blackhole attacks. A brute-force approach is to 
                        try one route and if there is no response, then try another route. Another approach is to increase the 
                        number of ACK messages sent, nodes in the path to the destination node will send ACK messages to the 
                        origin node so that the origin knows packets have not been dropped. The most efficient approach seems 
                        to be keeping a table in memory that tracks the level of trust between known neighboring nodes. Essentially, 
                        if two nodes have a successful packet transmission, then they will trust each other more.
                    </p>

                    <h2> Goals of The Project </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        By the end of this project, I will have developed my own strategy to find blackhole nodes and prevent trusted 
                        nodes from sending packets in their direction. I like the approach of developing a trust table.

                    <h2> Interesting Things I Am Finding </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Right now, I am currently looking into different routing protocols that I can use in a
                        simulated environment. One of the most popular MANET routing protocols is 
                        <a href="">Better Approach To Mobile AdHoc Networks</a> (B.A.T.M.A.N.). This routing 
                        protocol is an open-source protocol that only considers layer 2 information as opposed 
                        to the well-established layer 3 methods.
                        <br>
                        I am currently investigating how the protocol determines the cost of each path. To do this,
                        I first need to familiarize myself with structs in C. Also, I am attempting to install BATMAN on 
                        a Linux VM, but am struggling to accomplsih this due to there being no gudies for it. Most of 
                        the guides online seem to be focused on installing BATMAN on the <a href="">OpenWRT OS</a>.
