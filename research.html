                    <h2> About My Research </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p> 
                        At CSUMB, I am apart of a program called <a>UROC</a> which is an undergraduate research 
                        program. The goal of the program is to provide undergraduate students with an opportunity
                        to conduct graduate-level research. Each participant works on a project with the help of
                        their research advisor. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        The focus of my research falls under the category of mesh networks, mesh network security, and 
                        layer 3 attacks. Specifically, I am investigating Blackhole attacks, which is a form of 
                        layer 3 DoS attacks which can disrupt network reliability (more on this later). My 
                        research advisor is <a>Dr. Sam Ogden</a> who was also my professor for the Intro to Computer 
                        Networks course. We created this project as I was enrolled in that course. Mesh networks 
                        were something that me and a fellow classmate shared an interest in.
